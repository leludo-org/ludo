## Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to our project! Here are a few guidelines to make it easy for everyone.

1. ### Issues and Pull Requests

   - #### Start with an Issue
        Before making any changes, check if there’s already an issue describing what you want to work on.
     - If it doesn’t exist, create a new issue to give others context.
     - Describe the problem or enhancement you want to address.

   - #### Link Your Pull Request to an Issue
        Every pull request should link to an issue.
     - Reference the issue in your PR description (e.g., Fixes #issue_number).
     - This helps keep discussions organized and gives us a clear record of what each PR is meant to address.

2. ### Submitting a Pull Request

   - #### Describe Your Changes
     Provide a short summary of what your PR does and why. If your PR fixes a bug or adds a feature, mention that.

   - #### Make Sure It Works
     Before submitting, test your changes to make sure they work as expected and don’t break anything else in the project.

3. ### Working with Feedback

   - #### Respond to Review Comments
     We may suggest some changes. Please respond or update your PR as needed.

   - #### Stay Engaged
     If you’re available to make changes after your PR is merged, that’s always appreciated.
