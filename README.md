## Project Setup and Running Local Server

This project is still in early development, and while the current setup involves several Node.js dependencies, future
iterations aim to simplify the process with fewer dependencies. For now, please follow these steps to get the local
server running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed globally:

1. Node.js: Download and install from Node.js official website.
2. Install Development Dependencies:

    ```
    npm install -g live-server tailwindcss @go-task/cli
    ```

## Running the Local Server

1. Navigate to the project root in your terminal.
2. Run the task using Go Task CLI:

    ```
    task dev
    ```

This will start the necessary processes to run the local server.

### Note

This setup is temporary and intended for development purposes. In the future, this process will be streamlined with
fewer dependencies, making it easier and cleaner to run.
